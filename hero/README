Hero:
The world is filled with strength and weakness, responsibility
and temptation, good and evil. The consequences of the choices
we make are not always clear and often the simplest decisions
have the largest impact on our future. A strong arm or quick
wits do not make a hero. Instead, a hero is made by the challenges
they face and the choices they make. You will come across many
challenges and choices in your journey, and each decision will
have its consequences, and not every hero's journey has a happy
ending. What kind of hero will you be?



HERO is a rpg/platform/adventure game designed to show player/
character progression and growth through various challenges and 
decisions. As the description indicates, these decisions impact 
the story the player is exposed to and not every path leads to
success. The game will be designed to be difficult to complete
but will have a definitive ending unlike some stories. The hope
of this game is to teach the player that goodness lies within
us all, but that the journey of a hero sometimes requires hard
decisions. To quote A Song Of Ice And Fire, "Life is not a song"
